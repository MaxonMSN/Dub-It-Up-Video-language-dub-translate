# Dub It Up

Dub It Up is a video translation tool that automatically dubs the audio in your input video into your chosen language. It also generates word-level transcripts with timing, making your video accessible for localization, subtitles, and educational purposes.

- **Authentic Dubbing**
  - Maintains the original emotion and pacing for natural dubbing results.
